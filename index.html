            <h1>Hi, I'm Dallas!</h1>
            <p>I'm an aspiring developer who loves to design and build new things for people to use and enjoy. I'm always looking to learn how to do something new, and coding always has those sorts of opportunities. Take a look around and see what you think of my work!</p>

                    <h3>What I Do Now</h3>
                    <p>For most of my career, I've made a living from being the resident computer geek on a team of business associates. Most recently, my role for the last seven years has been primarily based in a somewhat niche subset of front-end, working in SharePoint and Power Platform development. I design and maintain site collections, intake forms, and automation workflows to make the lives of my colleagues just a bit easier.</p>

                    <h3>Ready for a Change</h3>
                    <p>I had already started learning more general front-end development months ago, but recently my current employer announced a change in their business model. While good for the business as a whole, it would mean that over the next several months, many positions would no longer be needed, including those of me and my colleagues. So this seemed like the perfect time to begin exploring opportunities to take the next step towards becoming a full-time developer.</p>

                    <h3>The Man Behind the Work</h3>
                    <p>Outside of work, I'm a lifelong gamer, I love to draw, travel, cook and/or bake, or hang out with my husband, David, and our Boston Terrier, Bruno. I'm always looking for something new to learn, and my latest projects include a beginner's study of Japanese and (slowly) learning to play the piano.</p>

                    <h3>Character Concept Generator</h3>
                    <p class="description">As a long-time tabletop nerd, I've taught many people to play games like D&D or Pathfinder over the years. One of the most common obstacles new players have is being overwhelmed with options and not knowing what they want to play. This tool, which generates a random character concept was a project I began to envision from my very first lesson in the <strong>Vue.js</strong> framework. I've already shared it with some of my gaming friends, and some of them already have players they want to show it to before their next games.<br>

                    <h3>Grocery List (Updated)</h3>
                    <p class="description">We keep a physical whiteboard on the wall in our kitchen, and throughout the week, we add things to it as they come to mind. And then, as often as not, we go to the grocery on Saturday...and forget everything on the whiteboard. When I saw someone build a grocery list app, I was intrigued, but as I looked over the code, there were a few things I thought were missing. Most notably the app was rather plain-looking. Also the app was missing the ability to undo the strikethrough on an item if you clicked it by mistake. I decided to rebuild the app with a few of my own additions, and here is the result.<br>
